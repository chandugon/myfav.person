            <h1 style="color: white;">Dr. A.P.J Abdul Kalam</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 22px; color: white;">  Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, whose full name was Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, stands as one of India’s most revered scientists and leaders. Born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, into a humble family, he overcame early financial hardships through determination and hard work. Kalam’s academic journey began at St. Joseph’s College, Tiruchirappalli, where he studied Physics, followed by Aeronautical Engineering at the Madras Institute of Technology.
            <br><br>
            Kalam’s career began at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) in 1958, and he later joined the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). At ISRO, he played a pivotal role in developing India’s first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-3), which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in 1980. His leadership in missile technology, particularly with the Agni and Prithvi missiles, earned him the title “Missile Man of India.” He was also instrumental in advancing India’s nuclear capabilities, notably during the Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998.
            <br><br>
            Dr. Kalam served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007 and was loved by all generations for his wisdom, humility, and vision for a developed India. His life continues to inspire millions of young Indians to dream big and serve the nation selflessly.
